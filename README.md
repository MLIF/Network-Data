# Network-Data
The network data used in "Identifying influential spreaders by gravity model" and "Identifying influential spreaders in complex networks by an improved gravity model".

PS: All networks are transformed into undirected networks. More specifically, WV contains the nodes in the largest WCC of Wikipedia vote network, WV_7115 contains all the nodes of Wikipedia vote network. WV is used in "Identifying influential spreaders by gravity model" while WV_7115 is used in "Identifying influential spreaders in complex networks by an improved gravity model".
